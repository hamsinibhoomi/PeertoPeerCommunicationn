Executing server :

java server <listen-port-number>

Note that the listen port number must be between 65400 and 65500 while testing on VCL Linux images.

Executing client :

java client <server-ip-address> <server-port-number>

The program asks for two other options, the upload port (between 65400 and 65500) and the full path of the directory in
which the RFCs are shared from.
